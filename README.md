# JavaScript as a Second Language

This repository contains practice examples that I created while taking the [JavaScript as a Second Language](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/javascript-as-a-second-language?u=142500650) course on LinkedIn Learning. The course covers the basics of JavaScript syntax, data types, operators, control structures, functions, objects, arrays, and more.

## How to use this repository

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a chapter in the course. Inside each folder, you will find one or more JavaScript files that contain the code examples and exercises from the course. You can run the JavaScript files using Node.js or any other JavaScript environment of your choice.

## What I learned from this course

By taking this course, I learned how to:

- Write and execute JavaScript code using variables, constants, expressions, and statements
- Use different data types and operators to manipulate data and perform calculations
- Control the flow of execution using conditional statements, loops, and functions
- Create and use objects and arrays to store and manipulate complex data
- Use built-in objects and methods to work with strings, numbers, dates, math, and more
- Debug and handle errors using console methods and try/catch blocks
